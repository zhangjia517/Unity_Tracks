(Version numbers: http://semver.org/)

2.0.0:
	Changes:
		- CatmullRom and Linear curve types have been removed.
			- These cure types do not guarantee that the tangent of the curve matches the direction of the
				curve at the start and end points.
			- Hermite curves now allow you to control to strength of the curve at the beginning and end.
		- Existing Hermite curves should retain their shape, but may not be generated pixel-for-pixel the same as
			last release.
		- All track scripts were moved into a namespace. Add "using ZenFulcrum.Track;" to the top of any file using track
			APIs.
		- The field CartTrack.currentTrack has been replaced with the property CartTrack.CurrentTrack.
			- SwitchCurrentSectionTo is now deprecated, use track.CurrentTrack = x instead.
	Features:
		- Curve start and end points now have strengths, allowing better control over the curve.
			- When editing the start or end of a track piece, use the new purple ball to adjust the curve strength.
		- Added snap-cart-to-track button. Use it to align an assigned cart to its track or to assign a new cart
			to the nearest track and align it.
		- Add new demos for:
			- Creating a multi-car train.
			- Creating a touch control to switch track between nodes.
		- Added new TrackCartSound script for adding sounds to carts. See the readme under "Cart Sounds" for details.
		- Two carts with their sound set up are included in the Prefabs folder.
		- Examples of the other track profiles are included in the Prefabs folder. (You may have to re-assign textures if
			using Unity 4.)
		- TrackSwitcher can now switch the start of the track.
		- TrackSwitcher can be manually switched during play mode from the inspector.
	Fixes:
		- Cart tracking has been overhauled.
			- Sharp corners and strangely shaped pieces should no longer explode or continue straight.
			- Strangely shaped pieces should no longer face a (notably different) different direction than the track
				section they are on.
			- Single pieces that loop should now work, provided they doesn't self-intersect (or nearly self-intersect)
				and aren't too cusp-like.
		- Limit the number of rail ties we will generate to something sane.
		- Remove some empty/unused bits.
		- Lots of spelling fixes.
		- TrackSwitcher doesn't force a switch on startup.
		- Added a warning in the Editor when you try to modify static geometry.
		- Added copyright header to C# files.
		- Acceleration on a TrackCart is determined correctly for stopped and very slow bodies, even when only reverse
			thrust is allowed.
		- TrackSwitcher won't get stuck between positions if switched away and back before a transition completes.
		- Other minor fixes.
